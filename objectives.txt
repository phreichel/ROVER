=  ROVER Objectives
=======================================

[O1]
The goal is to build a modular robot rover based on arduino and maybe raspbery pie,
with the help of a desktop computer and a WLAN network.

[O2]
The method to develop the rover is the vmodel top down aproach in which
* first all stakeholder needs are collected and
* then organised and uniquely numbered and refined in a requirements engineering process
* After this the requirements are split down into functional sub modules that ideally also represent a physical module if possible
* and interface requirements between module boundaries are defined
* Then the design of the sub modules and the integrated overall design is made with full traceability to the requirements
* Then the test objectives are defined from the requirements
* and the test procedures are written.
* Then the design is defined in detail as CAD parts and assemblies, schematics and spoftware code.
* Then the software code is tested, and the built and assembled CAD parts and schematics are tested based on the test procedures defined before.
* A full traceability between requirements design implementation test objectives and tests has to be established.

[O3]
The development must be capable to maintain several parallel builds in different stages
and to allow parallel development on different snapshots without getting confused.
